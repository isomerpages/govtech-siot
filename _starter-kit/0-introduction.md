## Sypnosis
The starter kit uses both [MANUCA](/tech-stack/manuca) and [DECADA Cloud](/tech-stack/decada-cloud/) Tech Stack. It is designed to help you get started with sending data from a sensor node, MANUCA, to the government cloud, DECADA Cloud.

At the end of this getting started guide, you would be pumping ambient temperature data using the on-board temperature sensor to your DECADA Cloud account, and be able to see it on your DECADA dashboard.

[Pre-order](https://go.gov.sg/iotkit-preorder) is available now.
