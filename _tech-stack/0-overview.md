# Singapore Government Tech Stack - Sensors and IoT

To enable government agencies to build services quickly and effectively, GovTech has developed the [**Singapore Government Tech Stack**](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/singapore-government-tech-stack/) (SGTS). Traditionally, most agencies develop their own services and infrastructure to meet the needs of the specific citizen or business group they serve, and may not be the fastest or most efficient way. With SGTS, agencies would be able to tap on a suite of tools and services hosted on a common infrastructure to ensure consistency, security and high quality of their applications.

Agencies can focus on designing solutions that best meet the needs of those they serve, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Citizens can expect a more secure, seamless, consistent and connected user experience across the spectrum of government digital services.

The Sensors and IoT stack consists of 3 core components: 

- [**MANUCA**](/tech-stack/manuca/overview/): a family of low power data acquisition products designed to integrate multiple low-bandwidth sensors and publish their measure points to DECADA Cloud swiftly.
- [**DECADA Edge Gateway**](/tech-stack/decada-edge/): a product and software solution to onboard new and existing sensor nodes to DECADA securely with ease. It is both a Gateway to DECADA and an Edge to process and aggregate sensor nodes data to reduce data traffic to DECADA. 
- [**DECADA**](/tech-stack/decada-cloud/): a multi-tenant cloud platform that provides support for device management, data acquisition and data analytics of IoT devices.
