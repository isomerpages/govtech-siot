The eCanvas is a prototype that helps people with disabilities to paint independently.

It consists of a voice-activated easel stand (that can go up/down, left/right) and a colour dispenser with five colours numbered 1 to 5. A user needs to give voice commands, e.g. “Down”, and the easel will move downwards; “2”, and the corresponding paint colour will be dispensed onto a palette for her to use. 

Watch this video to see how this project is helping Elaine, a 19-year-old artist living with cerebral palsy:

The entire prototype - comprising the structure and colour dispenser (both made from easily available raw materials), neural network voice recognition and motor control - was designed and developed by GovTech’s Sensors & Internet of Things (SIOT) team.

The eCanvas is flexible enough to be customised to people with other types of special needs, and can be produced at scale cost-effectively, as opposed to a bespoke commercial product.
