## Synopsis

The SIOT Starter Kit uses both [DECADA Embedded](/core-products/decada-embedded/) and [DECADA Cloud](/core-products/decada-cloud/) Tech Stack. It is designed to help you get started with sending data from an embedded device, DECADA Embedded, to the government IoT cloud, DECADA Cloud.

At the end of this getting started guide, you would be sending ambient temperature data using the on-board temperature sensor to your DECADA Cloud account, and be able to see it on your DECADA Cloud dashboard.

This kit was used in both STACK-X 2019 and STACK2020 conference workshops.
